## How to use:

Start Local DEV Server:

```javascript
npm start
```

This will automatically execute the npm install command to avoid adding dependencies during development and others get errors because they forgotten to run it previously.

On succesfull init it will keep watching for changes and compiling the code with the new changes

PRODUCTION BUILD

```javascript
npm run release
```

After the production task is completed the "dist" folder will contain the final files, compiled, concatenated and minified for server deployment.

Unit tests:

```javascript
npm run test
```

This will start the Karma server with the PhantonJS browser and it will generate the coverage report in the project directory.
